Bentley's Rules That are not implemented in the GCC compiler:

  A. Data Structures:
    1. Packing and Encoding
    2. Augmentation
    3. Sparsity

  B. Logic:
    1. Algebraic Identities
    2. Short Circuiting (In terms of Logic and not operators)
    3. Ordering Tests
    4. Combining Tests

  C. Loops :
    1. Sentinels (Not done by compiler in some situations)
    2. Eliminating wasted iterations

  D. Functions :
    1. Tail recursion elimination
    2. Coarsening recursion
